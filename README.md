## Recognizing patterns on 3 X 3 pixel pictures using Neural Networks

##### Overview of the repository
This repository contains a main file "Recognize Patterns.ipynb" where we can find a Machine Learning algorythm used for recognizing patterns on a black and white 9 pixel picture.

##### What kind of patterns will be recognized?
There are 4 main patterns that the alogrythm is recognizing. 
The first one is the solid pattern:

As we can see all of the 9 pixels of the image are solid black. That is the only configuration of pixels possible for this pattern. This one is the easiset to recognize.
